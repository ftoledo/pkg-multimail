 The Blue  Wave Offline  Mail System  File  Structures  (hereafter
 known as "structures" or "the structures") were created by George
 Hatchew, and  are the  copyrighted property of George Hatchew and
 Cutting Edge  Computing.  Permission is granted for third parties
 to use  these structures  in  their  own  programs,  without  any
 royalties or  licenses required.  Cutting Edge Computing reserves
 the right  to make  any changes to these structures, at any time.
 As such, third parties are requested not to make any unauthorized
 changes to  these structures,  as Cutting  Edge Computing  is not
 bound to  follow these  changes.   Any proposed changes should be
 brought to  the attention  of Cutting  Edge Computing, where they
 may be included in future revisions of the structures.
 .
 Authors that use these structures are allowed to claim that their
 programs are  "Blue Wave compatible", provided that such programs
 can process  mail and  reply packets  that can be handled without
 problems or  difficulties by The Blue Wave Offline Mail Doors and
 Readers from Cutting Edge Computing.  (Think of it as the "litmus
 test" for Blue Wave compatibility.)
 .
 Finally, "Blue  Wave" is  a  trademarked  term  of  Cutting  Edge
 Computing, and  cannot be  used by authors in the titles of their
 applications.   This does  not, however,  restrict the ability to
 describe the application as a "Blue Wave compatible" offline mail
 application (i.e.  "FooBar: The Blue Wave-Compatible Offline Mail
 Door for Widget BBS").
